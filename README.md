## How it works

1. **Tell it what you want.** A topic, rough notes, or a full outline — whatever you have.
2. **It generates a theme.** A custom color palette, typography, and a 2-slide preview in that style. It opens the preview for you.
3. **You decide.** Love it? It builds the whole deck. Want a different vibe? It generates a fresh direction and shows a new preview. Repeat until it's right.
4. **You get your deck.** A polished, self-contained presentation, ready to present, share, or export.

## Features

- **Confirm before you build** — a short preview lets you confirm the theme before the full deck is generated.
- **Custom themes every time** — a fresh palette, fonts, and layout system designed for *your* topic. No recycled templates.
- **Distinctive by default** — deliberately avoids generic fonts and cliché palettes.
- **One self-contained file** — share it, host it anywhere, no dependencies to install.
- **Present like a pro** — keyboard/touch navigation and a speaker view with private notes (press **S**).
- **Export to PDF** — a static handout straight from the browser.
- **Deploy to a live URL** — publish to a free static host (Surge, Vercel, or Netlify) and share a link that works on any device.

## Export to PDF

Just ask the agent to export the deck, and it walks you through it. To do it yourself: add `?print-pdf` to the deck URL, then open the print dialog (Cmd/Ctrl + P) and save as PDF. Choose Landscape, set margins to None, and turn on background graphics.
