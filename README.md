# slide-wright

AI agent skill to generate beautiful, unique slide decks with reveal.js - new design for every prompt.

## How it works

1. **Tell it what you want.** A topic, rough notes, or a full outline — whatever you have.
2. **It generates a theme.** A custom color palette, typography, and a 2-slide preview in that style. It opens the preview for you.
3. **You decide.** Love it? It builds the whole deck. Want a different vibe? It generates a fresh direction and shows a new preview. Repeat until it's right.
4. **You get your deck.** A polished, self-contained presentation. Export it to PDF, or deploy it to a live URL for a link that works on any device.

## Installation

### Claude Code (Plugin Marketplace)

1. Register the marketplace:

   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add arifszn/slide-wright
   ```

2. Install the plugin from this marketplace:

   ```bash
   /plugin install slide-wright
   ```

### Other agents (Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini, Cursor, …)

slide-wright is a standalone skill that works in any agent supporting the `SKILL.md` format. See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for per-agent skills paths.

Just tell your agent to install it — paste:

```
Fetch and follow the install instructions from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arifszn/slide-wright/refs/heads/main/INSTALL.md
```

Or install it via npx:

```bash
npx skills add arifszn/slide-wright
```

## Usage

After installing, tell your agent what you want:

```
Make me a slide deck about <your topic>
```

It builds a theme and a short preview first. Approve it and it generates the full deck. You can hand it rough notes or an outline instead of a topic, and ask it to revise the design or content anytime.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F | Fullscreen |
| Esc / O | Slide overview |
| S | Speaker view with notes |
| B / . | Pause to a black screen |

## Export to PDF

Just ask the agent to export the deck, and it walks you through it. To do it yourself: add `?print-pdf` to the deck URL, then open the print dialog (Cmd/Ctrl + P) and save as PDF. Choose Landscape, set margins to None, and turn on background graphics.
